		<!-- <h2>SAP Regression Testing (RT)</h2><br> -->
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>Regression Testing (RT) is performed to assess &amp; find out the potential impact the new changes could have on the existing functionalities/business processes and work with the respective teams to eliminate them before moving into Production.</p>

		<h4>What are we doing?</h4>
		
		<ul>
				<li>Regression Testing for all the Projects &amp; Warranty, Enhancement Requests &amp; Warranty and Production Support fixes across all regions that goes into Production</li>
				<li>EHP/SP Upgrade Testing across SAP systems landscape as applicable</li>
				<li>Maintain &amp; own Regression Test Scripts Repository as custodians (1700+ scripts across APPLE Business processes as of Feb-2017)</li>
				<li>Perform Onapsis Security Testing, iOS/MacOS Upgrade Testing and Browser Testing as required</li>
				<li>Automate RT Test scripts which qualify and use for Regression Testing as well as EHP/SP upgrades</li>
				<li>Perform testing for Month end Vertex patch upgrades planned for tax updates</li>
				<li>Carry out detailed Change Request (CR) Analysis periodically and ascertain the root causes</li>
				<li>Manage Change Management process end-to-end. Change management process ensures that new changes are moved to Production systems with built in checks &amp; balances to have a seamless implementation</li>
				<li>Maintain &amp; own the HP ALM Tool to be used for Regression and EHP/SP upgrade Testing as well as the Test Script Repository</li> 
				<li>Follow RT-PLC (RT - Project Life Cycle) for all Projects. Involve and travel throughout the lifecycle of the project right from Kick-Off until P2S handover:
					<ul>
						<li>Participate in Project Kick off &amp; Design meetings</li> 
						<li>Identify, share and walk through RT test scripts relevant to the change with the projects team for IT</li> 
						<li>Understand the changes with projects team conducting System Demo and IT test case walk through</li> 
						<li>Review IT &amp; UAT Test results and defects as applicable </li> 
						<li>Discuss with Project team, Scope and Perform Regression testing for all regions as applicable</li> 
						<li>Organize retrospective meeting with the projects team and seek feedback on RT performance (In-progress)</li> 
						<li>Perform Root Cause Analysis for defect slippage due to RT miss, if any</li> 
					</ul>
				</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Provide enough heads-up on the upcoming RT requirement well in advance for better planning and scoping (particularly when there is a change in the project timelines)</li>
				<li>General RT time line of 2 weeks is subject to change upwards/downwards depending on the scope and size of the projects / tickets; this would be mutually discussed and agreed </li>
				<li>RT Scoping Template completeness is mandatory for RT execution. Get <a href="https://connectme.apple.com/docs/DOC-79733" target="_blank">more information</a> in regression test scoping</li> 
				<li>Project Team to share the unique IT scripts post IT phase or during P2S handover phase, which would be inducted into the RT Test Repository post validation</li>
				<li>RT team's involvement during Project Life Cycle should be an integral part of the PLC. Get <a href="https://connectme.apple.com/docs/DOC-181309" target="_blank">more information</a> on RT processes</li>
				<li>CS-SR tickets with Catalog item "SAP Regression Testing" including details in RT scoping template has to be assigned to workgroup SAP RT Team</li>
<li>Any fix that involves configuration, variant change, batch job changes will typically not require RT to be performed. The concerned team shall work with the RT team and may get a waiver accordingly</li>
